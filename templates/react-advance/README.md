* Auto refresh whenever you make a change in your code.
* Directory `./dist` is deleted and then created automatic every time you run the command `npm run build`.
* CSS, JS files injected automatic into HTML template file `index.html`.
* Using only for `react-code-splitting` template:
    * Code splitting: Your code compiled into directory `./dist` with three separate file extensions `*.html, *.css, *.js`.
    * Image handling: Auto copy only directory `./src/images` into `./dist` when you compile your code or during development -> Improve performance.
    * You can use `async`/ `await` for fetching data from API in your code.
